# Table & chart blocks: the shaper / renderer architecture

Captured 2026-06-13 from a design session. This is the **reference model** for the
table/chart block cleanup, and the single concept doc for blockr.bi's block
roles — the concrete bug / file-level cleanup queue (folded from the old
`REVIEW_TODO.md`, 2026-05-21) lives at the bottom. Companion AI-tuning notes live
in `blockr.ai/dev/harness-prompting-lessons.md`.

The motivating realization: blockr.bi had grown several overlapping "table" blocks
(`pivot_table`, `summary_table`, `gt_table`, `html_table`, `drilldown_table`) and a
parallel chart/tile/kpi set, with names that described *features* rather than
*roles*. This note defines the roles so every block has one obvious place.

---

## TL;DR — the five layers

Every block in a dashboard pipeline is one of five kinds. Data flows left to right;
**a renderer only ever sees a tidy/rectangular data frame.**

| Layer | Job | Output | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | compute / summarise | **tidy df** | `describe`, `correlate`, `frequencies`, `survival`, `padjust`, + dplyr verbs (`summarize`, `filter`, …) |
| **Reshape** | tidy → display grid (wide, *on purpose*) | wide df | dplyr `pivot_wider` |
| **Fit** | fit a statistical model | **model object** | `model` |
| **Adapt** | model → tidy | tidy df | `broom` (tidy / glance / augment) |
| **Render** | df → pixels | UI | `table`, `chart`, `tile`, `gt`, `ggplot` |

Two invariants make the system predictable:

1. **Verbs compute (tidy out); nouns render.** If a block's name is a verb it
   returns a tidy data frame you can keep transforming. If it's a bare noun it draws.
2. **Renderers only see tidy/rectangular data.** The *only* non-df intermediate in
   the whole system is a fitted model, and it is fenced off — it exists solely
   between `model` and `broom`. A coefficient table is `model → broom → table`; no
   renderer ever touches a fit.

## Render layer — the noun blocks

### Interactive | static pairs
Each output medium has an **interactive** renderer (dashboard-native) and a
**static** renderer (print / CSR / report):

| Medium | Interactive | Static |
|---|---|---|
| table | **`table`** | `gt` |
| chart | **`chart`** (ECharts) | `ggplot` (blockr.ggplot) |
| number/spark/ring | **`tile`** | — |

Pick by destination: dashboards use `table` / `chart` / `tile`; print/CSR uses `gt`
/ `ggplot`. The static renderers conceptually belong with their toolkit packages
(`blockr.gt`, `blockr.ggplot`), not in blockr.bi — blockr.bi owns the *interactive*
renderers.

### Drill-down is a feature, not an identity
`table` and `chart` were `drilldown_table` / `drilldown_chart`. But `drill=` is one
opt-in capability (click-to-filter, **off by default**) — naming the whole block
after it overweighted a feature. These are simply *the* table and chart blocks; you
reach for them for almost every table/chart in a dashboard. **Renamed 2026-06-13**
(see "Done" below). The drill *feature* keeps its `drilldown-*` internals
(`drilldown-config.js`, `drilldown-theme.R`, `filter_*` transport) — only the block
identity changed.

### `table` is the universal interactive renderer
`html_table` and `table` are both interactive HTML tables with disjoint features
(`html_table` understands section/spanner structure; `table` has color + drill). The
plan: **fold `html_table`'s section/spanner/collapse rendering into `table`** so one
renderer handles flat *and* structured input, then retire `html_table`. ("drilldown
= universal renderer", deepen a few renderers over adding specialized ones.)

### `tile` supersedes `kpi`
`tile`'s `showcase = "number"` covers everything `kpi` does (big numbers), plus
`"spark"` and `"progress"`. `kpi` is **deprecated** (done — see below). Note their
APIs differ (`kpi`: flat `measures/agg_fun/…`; `tile`: `showcase` + `state`), so
`kpi` *cannot* forward to `tile` — existing kpi blocks keep rendering as kpi via the
kept constructor; new work uses tile.

### Deprecation policy: **unregister, don't tag**
When a block is deprecated it is **removed from `register_bi_blocks()` and the MCP
universe** (so the picker and the AI stop offering it), but its **constructor stays
exported** with a `lifecycle::deprecate_soft()` nudge. blockr.core deserializes a
saved block by **constructor name** (`get0()`), not via the registry, so existing
boards keep loading. No "[Deprecated]-but-still-in-the-picker" half-measure.

### `waterfall` — a **baseline mode on the bar chart**, not a new chart type
`waterfall` today is a **specialized ECharts chart mislabeled as a transform** — it
aggregates the chosen `measures`, computes the cumulative bridge, and renders via a
*separate* echarts4r htmlwidget (the universal `chart` instead ships data as JSON to
`inst/js/drilldown-chart.js`). It is to be folded into `chart`, but the right framing
is **not** "another `chart_type`":

**A waterfall is a bar chart.** Same contract (`group` + `metric` + `agg_fn`), same
cartesian axis, same factor-based ordering, same drill. The *only* difference is the
bars' **baseline**: a plain bar starts at 0; a waterfall bar starts where the previous
one ended (the running cumulative). So it is a **mode of bar**, not a sibling of it:

```
 BAR  baseline = 0            WATERFALL  baseline = running cumulative
                                     ┌────┐
       ┌────┐                        │+500│╌╌┐
  ┌────┤    │ ┌────┐                 │Rev │  │╌╌┐ ┌────┐
  │Rev │Cost│ │Prof│                 │    │  │Cost│ │300 │
  0────┴────┴─┴────┴─            0───┴────┴──┴────┴─┴────┴─
  (every bar starts at 0)        (each bar starts where the last ended)
```

Litmus test for "new `chart_type` vs option on an existing one": **does it change the
coordinate system?** Radar earned its own type (polar spokes). Waterfall is the *same*
cartesian bars with a shifted baseline → it's a **bar option**.

Design:
- **Model**: `bar` + `baseline = "zero" | "cumulative"` (+ sign-coloring: green up /
  red down — cosmetic). More general than P&L: cumulative bars are reusable.
- **Totals/subtotals** = a **per-bar baseline override** (a `type` column with
  `"relative"` / `"total"`; a `total` bar resets its baseline to 0). This is ECharts'
  native model and rides through `pivot_longer` as just another column — the one bit
  of info beyond `group + metric`.
- **Data contract** = long: `group` = step axis, `metric` = value, exactly like every
  other aggregated chart. Wide P&L data (`Revenue|Costs|Profit` as columns) is
  `pivot_longer`'d to `(step, value)` first — a composable reshape, consistent with
  "reshape upstream". Step **order** is the step column's factor levels (standard
  categorical ordering, not waterfall-special); the bar renderer must honor data order
  for this mode (don't value-sort).
- **Implementation**: add the `baseline` mode to the existing **bar** branch in
  `drilldown-chart.js` (compute running cumulative, honor per-bar total reset,
  sign-color). No new data contract, no new axis logic, no second rendering stack —
  much smaller than a bespoke waterfall renderer. In the UI, "Waterfall" can still be a
  named `chart_type` choice, but it's *sugar* for `bar + baseline="cumulative"`.

Keep `new_waterfall_block` registered until the bar baseline-mode lands (no replacement
before then); then deprecate it like the others (unregister, keep constructor).

### Renderer responsibilities (and the boundary)
A renderer **draws** and **formats**; it does **not** compute or reshape.
- ✅ draw structure (sections / spanners / indents), format numbers (decimals),
  color, drill, sort/search.
- ❌ aggregate, reshape, run statistics.

The one bounded exception worth naming: a chart self-aggregates because the visual
encoding *is* the aggregation (a bar = sum-of-group). That asymmetry is correct —
charts take raw data + an aesthetic mapping; tables take an already-shaped table.

The pharma `"13 (18.8%)"` cell (n + pct) is the lone thing on the compute/draw
boundary; it is resolved by the **`.fmt` convention** below — the renderer formats,
the shaper stays tidy numbers.

### The `.fmt` convention (cell formatting, resolved)
Cell formatting rides in a **hidden dotted column `.fmt`**, exactly like `.indent` /
`.label` / `.section_*` — the numbers stay in plain numeric columns (`dplyr`-able),
and `.fmt` is a per-row **template that names the columns to combine**:

```
 .fmt = "{estimate} ({std.error})"      -> "0.05 (0.01)"
 .fmt = "{n} ({pct}%)"                  -> "38 (54%)"
 .fmt = "{mean} ({sd})"                 -> "65.2 (8.1)"
 .fmt = "{median} ({q1}, {q3})"         -> "12 (8, 19)"
 .fmt = "{or} ({conf.low}–{conf.high})" -> "1.8 (1.2–2.7)"
```

The renderer is **pure interpolation**: glue the named columns into the literal
template — no codebook of named formats, no domain knowledge, no per-stat branching.

Three properties make this the resolution of the n(%) question:
1. **Defaults first.** A renderer column-default formats a raw tidy frame (e.g. a
   `broom` table) with **zero** annotation: `p.value`→3 dp/stars, `estimate`→2 dp,
   etc. `.fmt` is the **override**, needed only when formatting varies **per row** (a
   mixed Table 1: some rows `n (%)`, some `mean (sd)`).
2. **Rounding stays out of `.fmt`** — column defaults or a `digits` hint own it. Keep
   `.fmt` to "names + punctuation"; don't grow a `sprintf` mini-language.
3. **Format-then-spread** for grouped tables. The cell's numbers are on the same row,
   so combine **per row first**, then a *plain* `pivot_wider(names_from = group,
   values_from = <formatted cell>)`. Order matters: format before spreading (spreading
   raw `n`/`pct` first forces messy column-pairing). Both steps are render-time, so the
   shaper's output stays the tidy numbers.

**One structure for every table.** Table 1, regression (`broom`), survival, and
frequency tables are the *same* display: rows (`.section`/`.label`/`.indent`) ×
optional spread dimension (arm / model / subgroup) × composite cells (`.fmt`). One
`table` renderer + this convention covers all of them, fed by tidy shapers. Because
the numbers stay tidy, the *same* frame renders as combined cells **or** as separate
columns — a render choice, not baked in.

---

## Shape layer — the verb blocks

### Tidy by default
Shapers **always emit tidy data frames** — no display strings baked in. This is the
property that makes every shaper's output `dplyr`-able and re-renderable. Today
`summary_table` violates this: it `sprintf`s every cell to `"13 (18.8%)"` /
`"mean (sd)"` and **discards the raw numbers it already computed** (`stats_df` carries
`n`, `pct`, `mean`, `sd`, … and throws them away). The display formatting moves to
the renderer; the shaper emits the numbers. No `format` toggle — tidy is the only mode.

### The "earns a block" test
A computation earns its *own* block only if it is **bounded** (a finite, UI-able
config) **and** has **no clean primitive path** (no single dplyr/tidyr verb). Otherwise
compose existing blocks, or use `function_block` (the escape hatch for arbitrary,
unbounded transforms — *not* a substitute for a real block when the config is bounded).

| Candidate | Clean primitive path? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `correlate` | no — `cor()` returns a matrix, no verb | **own block** |
| `describe` (mixed numeric+categorical+logical, by group) | no — no single verb does mixed-type describe | **own block** |
| `pivot_table` | **yes** — `summarize` → `pivot_wider` | **demote/drop** (pure convenience macro) |
| correlation heatmap | = `correlate` → `table(cell_color)` | compose, no new block |

### Per-block decisions
- **`describe`** — the rich descriptive shaper (numeric stats + categorical n/pct +
  logical flags, by group, **tidy out**). This is `summary_table`'s compute core,
  separated from its formatting. Keep `summary_table` as the name unless we go to a
  verb (`describe`); either way it stops pre-formatting and emits tidy.
- **`descriptives`** (blockr.stats) — **retire.** Numeric-only, ungrouped, tidy; its
  own author notes it ≈ `dplyr::summarise(across(where(is.numeric), …))`. Fully
  subsumed by the rich `describe`. Stats users use `describe`/`summary_table`.
- **`frequencies`** (blockr.stats) — fold into `describe` later (it already does
  categorical counts); or keep as the dedicated 1-/2-way count shaper. Low priority.
- **`pivot_table`** (blockr.bi) — **demote/drop.** = `summarize` + `pivot_wider`,
  both clean dplyr verbs; adds no unique capability, only an Excel-pivot UX.
  It had no production caller (only its own demo). A crosstab is
  `summarize → pivot_wider → table`; the AI can compose that from one prompt.
- **`correlate`** — **new block** (the one genuine gap). df → tidy correlation matrix
  (`var` column + numeric columns; `method` arg). Rendered by `table(cell_color)` for
  the heatmap. Replaces the inline `transform="correlation"` currently in `table`
  (drop `transform`/`cor_method` from the renderer → keep it pure). Home: likely
  blockr.stats. NB: `new_correlation_matrix_block` is referenced in demos but **never
  defined** — remove those dead references.

### Fit / adapt (the modeling excursion)
`model` returns a **fitted model object**, not a df — verified against the source
(its roxygen: "broom adapter … turns it into tidy frames"). `broom` is the bridge
back to tidy df-land. This is the sanctioned out-of-df-and-back detour; `model` is a
*fitter*, not a shaper, and keeps its name. (`survival` already returns tidy;
`padjust` is df→df; `stat_test` / `effect_size` return types unverified — check
before classifying.)

---

## Naming system

- **verb → compute/shape, tidy out**: `describe`, `correlate`, `frequencies`,
  `model` (fit), `test`, …
- **bare noun → render**: `chart`, `table`, `tile`, `gt`, `ggplot`.
- **reshape** is just dplyr `pivot_wider` — no bespoke bi block.

So a pipeline reads as roles: `describe → table` ("describe these vars, show as a
table"), `correlate → table` (heatmap), `model → broom → table` (coefficients),
`summarize → pivot_wider → chart` (crosstab plotted).

### Renderer arg consistency (chart vs table)
- **Inherently different** (and correct): chart maps *aesthetics* (`x`, `y`, `group`,
  `series`, `facet`, `label`); table maps *roles* (`rowname`, `values`, `cell_color`).
  You can't put `x`/`y` on a table.
- **Shared cross-cutting concepts share names** (good, already true): `drill`,
  `digits`, the `filter_*` runtime transport.
- **`color` (chart) vs `cell_color` (table)** — deliberately distinct: chart `color`
  is a *categorical* series→hue mapping; table `cell_color` is a *numeric*
  value→background scale. Different operations, so different names — document the why
  so it doesn't read as an inconsistency.
- Internal renderer fn uses `label_col`/`value_cols`; the block uses `rowname`/
  `values`. **Unify on `rowname`/`values`** across both layers.

---

## Done (in the working tree, 2026-06-13, uncommitted)

- **Renderer rename**: `new_drilldown_chart_block → new_chart_block` (class
  `chart_block`, "Chart"); `new_drilldown_table_block → new_table_block` (class
  `table_block`, "Table"); `*_arguments()` and `config_effect.*` methods follow the
  class. blockr.core resolves a saved block by **constructor name** via `get0()`
  (verified against `blockr_deser.block`); blockr.mcp `block-universe` keys updated.
- **Aliases removed (2026-06-14)**: the deprecated forwarding aliases were deleted
  outright (no live callers remained), so `new_chart_block` / `new_table_block` are
  the sole constructors:
  - `new_drilldown_table_block` and the standalone `new_html_table_block` (class
    `html_table_block` + its `block_ui`/`block_output` methods) — `new_table_block`
    renders flat + structured input by reusing the `html_table()` builders.
  - `new_drilldown_chart_block` — `new_chart_block` is the sole chart block.
- **Files renamed (2026-06-14)** to drop the `drilldown-`/`html-` prefix:
  `drilldown-table-block.R → table-block.R`, `html-table-block.R → html-table.R`,
  `drilldown-chart-block.R → chart-block.R`, `drilldown-chart-arguments.R →
  chart-arguments.R`, `drilldown-chart-dep.R → chart-dep.R`; assets
  `drilldown-table.{js,css} → table.{js,css}`, `drilldown-chart.{js,css} →
  chart.{js,css}` (the shared `chart-css` dep is reused by table + tile popovers).
  KEPT (drill feature / shared, not block identity): `drilldown-config.js` engine,
  `drilldown-theme*.{R,js}` + `new_drilldown_theme_option`, `drilldown-ai-effect.R`
  (`config_effect` for both `chart_block` and `table_block`), and the internal
  `.drilldown-table-container` class / `drilldown_table_block` input id.
  Old boards referencing the removed constructors will not deserialize (accepted:
  blockr.bi is being renamed anyway).
- **blockr.input** `new_table_block` (CRUD) → `new_table_crud_block` to free the name.
- **`summary_table` AI args** tuned to 5/5 (all 9 `state` fields exposed,
  sections-nesting + `id_var` gating). See `blockr.ai/dev/summary-table-eval-live.R`.

## Open decisions

1. `gt` — keep a thin convention-aware adapter in bi, or move gt rendering entirely
   to `blockr.gt`? (Its only live consumer was `blockr.csr`, which is unused — see
   below.)
2. `summary_table` name — keep, or rename to the verb `describe`?
3. Verify `stat_test` / `effect_size` return types before placing them in the layers.

*(Resolved: `n (%)` cell formatting → the `.fmt` hidden-column convention above.)*

## Migration / TODO

- [ ] Make `summary_table` emit tidy numbers (stop discarding `stats_df`); move
      `n (%)` / `mean (sd)` formatting to the renderer.
- [ ] Add `correlate` block (df → tidy matrix); drop `transform`/`cor_method` from
      `table`; remove dead `new_correlation_matrix_block` references.
- [ ] Retire `descriptives` (blockr.stats); point users at `describe`/`summary_table`.
- [ ] Fold `html_table` section/spanner rendering into `table`; retire `html_table`.
- [x] **Remove `kpi`** — deleted outright *(2026-06-14)*, no compat shim (blockr.bi
      is being retired for blockr.viz, a conscious upgrade). Successor `new_tile_block`.
      Downstream boards (unibas, insurance, deploy apps) migrate to tile as part of the
      blockr.viz cutover.
- [x] **Remove `pivot_table`** — deleted outright *(2026-06-14)*. Successor is a
      composed `summarize → tidyr::pivot_wider → table`, not a bespoke block.
- [x] **Remove `waterfall`** — deleted outright *(2026-06-14)*. Successor
      `new_chart_block(chart_type = "waterfall")` (bar + `baseline = "cumulative"`).
- [ ] Move/clarify `gt` ownership (blockr.gt vs bi adapter).
- [ ] Unify `rowname`/`values` naming across block + internal renderer.

## Concrete bugs & file-level cleanup

Folded from `REVIEW_TODO.md` (2026-05-07 / 05-21) when that doc was retired. These
are the *implementation* items the architecture above doesn't cover — strategy items
that REVIEW_TODO also held (kpi/pivot deprecation, html_table fold, lifecycle policy)
are resolved in the sections above and dropped. **Line numbers predate the 2026-06-13
chart/table rename and may have drifted** — confirm before editing.

### Concrete bugs
- [ ] **`gt_table_arguments()` out of sync with its constructor** — advertises
  `indent_stat` (doesn't exist on `new_gt_table_block()`) and omits `na_rep` (which
  does). The MCP server mislead­s the AI. `R/block-arguments.R:117-147` vs
  `R/gt-table-block.R:363-368`.
- [ ] **`n_distinct` missing `na.rm = TRUE`** at `R/tile-block-expr.R:187` —
  inconsistent with neighbouring stats; silently mis-counts under NAs.
- [ ] **Dead parameter `stub_is_sortable <- FALSE`** in `R/html-table-block.R:64`.
- [ ] **Unchecked column access** — `data[[measures[i]]]` returns NA silently if an
  upstream block renames the column (`R/waterfall-block.R:184-185`,
  `R/drilldown-chart-block.R:117-128`). Validate in `dat_valid()` instead.

### Shape contract (shaper ↔ renderer)
- [ ] Replace the column-name **sniff** (`R/gt-table-block.R:47-48`,
  `R/html-table-block.R:50`) with an explicit attribute / `.blockr_table_format` S3
  class that `summary_table` tags and renderers validate. (Ties into the `.fmt` /
  dotted-column convention above — make the contract explicit, not inferred.)

### Migration leftovers
- [ ] **`gt_table()` legacy long-format branch** (`R/gt-table-block.R:195-337`): the
  "deprecation window" comment has no timeline and no test — commit to the deprecation
  or test/document the path.
- [ ] **Filter story** — `bi_filter` (defunct stub → `blockr.dm::new_value_filter_block`)
  + drill-on-`table`/`chart`. Document when to use which, or fold into one guide.
- [ ] **`bi_demo_data` is stale** — predates the wide-tibble contract; several demos
  still seed it. Regenerate against current shaper output or replace with
  `tile_demo_data` / `safetyData::adam_*` and delete it. Document which block consumes
  which dataset.
- [ ] **Rename `blockr.bi` → `blockr.dashboard`?** Open: "bi" reads as business
  intelligence, but the scope is dashboard primitives. Decide before wide release;
  blast radius = pkg name, NAMESPACE, demos, MCP `block_universe` `package` fields,
  blockr.docs cross-refs, install instructions.

### Heavy files / copy-paste
- [ ] **`html-table-block.R` (~923 lines)** inlines a ~620-line JS template + ~175
  lines of CSS as R strings — move to `inst/js/` and `inst/css/`. (Also the right
  moment to fold its section/spanner rendering into `table`, per above.)
- [ ] **`summary-table.R` (~893)** — `summary_table()` and `compute_hierarchy_run()`
  duplicate stat logic; share helpers. (Overlaps with making it emit tidy numbers.)
- [ ] **`kpi-block.R` (~609)** + **`waterfall-block.R` (~397)** share ~100 lines of
  state-mgmt boilerplate. (Both deprecated/folding — may resolve by deletion.)

### Shiny / JS coupling
- [ ] **Custom-message handlers aren't namespaced by instance** — `drilldown-chart-block.R`
  registers a global handler; a second instance overwrites the first. Put `ns()` in the
  payload so each instance only reacts to its own messages.
- [ ] **Theme registry is process-global** (`R/drilldown-theme.R:5-6`) — collisions if
  two boards register different themes under one name, or if `blockr.echarts` +
  `blockr.bi` both load.
- [ ] **State re-init on rebind** — `kpi`, `waterfall`, `drilldown_chart` overwrite
  restored state with constructor defaults when re-bound in a DAG. (Cf. the memory note
  on constructor-based state restore.)
- [ ] A few `observeEvent`s lack `bindEvent` / `ignoreInit` — minor, inconsistent.

### Tests
- [ ] No snapshot tests for `gt_table` / `html_table` output.
- [ ] No end-to-end "click bar → downstream filter applies" test.
- [ ] `dat_valid()` error paths aren't exercised anywhere.
- [ ] Two `drilldown-chart` tests `skip_if_not_installed("blockr.insurance")` — the
  click-to-filter path is effectively untested in CI. Move to a tagged integration
  suite or stub the dep.

## Related

`blockr.csr` (the unused CSR example dashboard) was the last live consumer of
`gt_table` + `html_table`; it's an archive candidate, which is what unblocks the
renderer convergence above. See the workspace memory note `project_blockr_csr_unused`.

## The unified renderer principles (2026-07-04, settled with Christoph)

All three interactive renderers — **chart, table, tile** — follow the same
contract, sharing one gear engine (`drilldown-config.js`), one aggregation
vocabulary (`drilldown-agg.js` / R `AGG_FNS`, drift-tested), and one filter
transport. The principles:

1. **Raw data in.** A renderer receives a tidy frame and never mutates the
   pipeline: in-block aggregation is a *display projection*; the block's data
   output stays the raw input filtered by the last click.
2. **Optionally aggregate.** The Aggregation capability is a checkbox section
   with the repeatable `[agg] of [cols]` metrics list (`metrics =
   list(list(agg_fn, cols))`, identical shape in all three blocks).
   - *No group* → one grand-total row / headline cards
     (`dplyr::summarise` without `.by`).
   - *Empty `cols` on a numeric aggregation* → all numeric columns MINUS
     columns claimed by other entries (override semantics, a rule that
     re-resolves against the current frame). The chart is the exception: it
     stays explicit (20 series from one empty picker is unreadable).
   - **The chart expresses raw-vs-aggregated via chart TYPE** (scatter/line
     ARE the raw view; a bar IS an aggregate), so its Aggregation section is
     the required stat, not a checkbox — the one designed exception. Plain
     bars take the full metrics list (one dodged series per aggregation x
     column); pie/treemap/radar/waterfall are structurally single-metric and
     keep the single pair. Multiple metrics and a `color` split are mutually
     exclusive (both want the series dimension).
3. **Optionally drill.** Every drill is OPT-IN (checkbox, default off) and
   emits the same categorical filter message. **The column picker exists only
   where the click is ambiguous**: a tile card or a grouped-table row is
   one-dimensional (target = the group keys / the Name column — hint-only
   checkbox); a RAW table row is n-dimensional (picker, seeded with the
   rowname/stub column); the chart offers Auto (the clicked mark) or a
   column. No meaningful target (bare KPI, grand totals, annotated frame) →
   no Drill-down section at all.
4. **Sections appear on demand, in one fixed order.** Always-on sections
   first (Mapping / the chart's required stat / Presentation); the opt-in
   capability checkboxes cluster at the BOTTOM: Aggregation → Drill-down →
   Coloring → Row color. Unchecked = a one-line header; checked reveals the
   config. Roles that don't apply are not offered (label is gantt-only,
   color is hidden on pie/treemap, "Secondary style" only with a secondary).
5. **Group means what the block means.** The table's group IS its
   aggregation (lives in the Aggregation section, seeds/clears with it). The
   tile's group is a *mapping* (clusters precomputed cards; also the
   `group_by` when metrics are set), so it lives under Mapping and survives
   unchecking Aggregation. The chart's group is an aesthetic (Mapping).
6. **Pre-aggregated input is respected.** A structured / annotated data
   frame (dot-prefixed layout columns) renders read-only structure: the
   in-block capabilities are hidden and a badge explains why.

Shared-asset hygiene: the engine + vocabulary ship in ONE dependency
(`drilldown_shared_dep()`), so an engine edit is a single version bump.
JS↔R vocabulary drift is guarded by tests (`test-agg-fns-drift.R`,
`test-stat-options-drift.R`); NA semantics match between the JS chart
aggregation and the R path (mean/sum skip NA; `n_distinct(na.rm = TRUE)`).
