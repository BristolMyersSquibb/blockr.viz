# blockr.viz 0.2.191

* The chart block's browser code is rewritten: `inst/js/chart.js` is
  replaced by separate model, option and view files in `inst/js/chart/`.
  Clicks follow the documented rules: a click always sends its filter and
  never toggles it off (Reset clears); a coloured segment, a facet panel
  and a scatter point's series filter what they show; a legend chip
  filters its level instead of hiding it; a brush takes the brushed points;
  the footer names the filter in column labels; a restored or latched
  filter, a range included, lights what holds filtered rows and dims the
  rest.

# blockr.viz 0.2.190

* The chart block's ggplot twin is gone: `static_chart()`, `chart_expr()`,
  `chart_code()` and the chart block's `report_call()` method. Chart
  downloads (png, web page, PowerPoint) carry the picture the browser drew.
  The Excel download writes the rows the chart is drawn from.
* The canvas capture kill switch is gone (`BLOCKR_CANVAS_CAPTURE`,
  `options(blockr.viz.canvas_capture)`). Chart, heatmap and rank blocks
  always export the captured picture.
